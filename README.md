An example configuration file might look like this:

```json
{
  "apiKeys": {
    "uniswap": "YOUR_UNISWAP_API_KEY",
    "solana": "YOUR_SOLANA_API_KEY"
  },
  "walletAddress": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS",
  "tradingParams": {
    "slippage": 0.5,
    "gasPrice": 1000000000
  }
}
```

## How It Works

The Mev-Sandwich-Bot uses advanced algorithms to identify trading opportunities. Here’s a simplified breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Mempool Analysis**: The bot continuously monitors the Ethereum and Solana mempools for pending transactions.
2. **Opportunity Detection**: It analyzes the data to find profitable trades based on current market conditions.
3. **Trade Execution**: When a profitable opportunity is detected, the bot executes trades automatically, taking advantage of price discrepancies.
4. **Profit Capture**: The bot captures profits by closing trades at the right time, ensuring a profitable outcome.
